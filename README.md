# Loan Eligibility Prediction Project
### Link for our project: [is here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B6MqtjxXmotlWhsUSyXcViUuPvvmUXHd?usp=sharing)

Our project contains a two step process which includes prediction for Credit History using random forest, and taking that credit history into consideration in calculating loan eligibility prediction using Logistic Regression , Naive Bayes Classifier and XG Boosting.

The main concept behind this project is to help banks to eliminate whoever is not worthy to get bank loan, and will result in a default.
